Write a Python program that calculates the area of a circle based on the radius entered by the user.

Python: Area of a Circle

In geometry, the area enclosed by a circle of radius r is πr2. Here the Greek letter π represents a constant, approximately equal to 3.14159, which is equal to the ratio of the circumference of any circle to its diameter.

Python: Area of a circle
Sample Solution:

Python Code:

# Import the 'pi' constant from the 'math' module to calculate the area of a circle
from math import pi

# Prompt the user to input the radius of the circle
r = float(input("Input the radius of the circle : "))

# Calculate the area of the circle using the formula: area = π * r^2
area = pi * r ** 2

# Display the result, including the radius and calculated area
print("The area of the circle with radius " + str(r) + " is: " + str(area))

Sample Output:

Input the radius of the circle : 1.1                                                                          
The area of the circle with radius 1.1 is: 3.8013271108436504
